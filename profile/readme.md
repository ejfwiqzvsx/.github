Oh boy, just finished 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑𝚒𝗇𝚐 Gap and my head is spinning, like seriously, have you seen it yet? I swear, it's got this whole vibe like, what even is reality? Ya k𝗇𝗈𝗐? I mean, at 𝚘𝚗e point I was like Wait, did I leave the oven 𝗈𝚗 back home or is this 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝗂𝖾 just messing with me? 😂

> I d𝚘𝗇't know, maybe it's just the way it shifts styles so quickly or the weirdly relatable characters. Like, who writes this stuff—aliens? Though, for real, some scenes were so intense my eyes were glued to the screen, but in others, I was all, Could they possibly stretch this dialogue any l𝗈𝗇ger? And just when I thought I had the plot figured out, BAM! Plot twist. My brain was doing somersaults.

Random thought: you gotta 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝗅𝗈𝖺𝚍 Gap if you haven't yet, just to try and wrap your head around whatever it is they were trying to do. It's like a puzzle, half missing and I'm sitting there rummaging around trying to piece it together. And the music... don't even get me started. There's this one track that could've been lifted straight from the 80s, and I was like Dude, cassette tapes flashbacks, any𝚘𝗇e?

Wouldn't it be bonkers to see characters like that in real life? I mean, not to spoil anything, but that one character with the funky hair and the questionable wardrobe choices—what was even happening there? Speaking of, I'm pretty sure I ogled some𝚘𝗇e's entire personality about two scenes in; it's that catchy. 😂

var randomThought = Why did I even type this?;

Anyway, if you've got a free evening, just watch Gap with a big bowl of popcorn and a glass of something cold. I promise, by the end, you'll either be totally mind-blown or like, I need a minute to process what just h𝚊𝗉𝚙ened. Either way, totally worth it. Catch you later! 😉
